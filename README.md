## Development

This extension is built with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no external build tools required, making it easy to modify and extend.

### Core Concepts

The extension is architected around three main types of scripts:

*   **Service Worker (`background.js` & `background/`):** This is the brain of the extension. It runs persistently in the background, manages the extension's state, handles all communication with the OpenAI API, orchestrates the data extraction process across multiple tabs, and listens for messages from other parts of the extension.
*   **Content Scripts (`content-*.js`):** These are the arms and legs. They are injected directly into the web pages of the supported platforms (Google, Reddit, etc.). Their sole purpose is to scrape the required data from the page's DOM and send it back to the service worker for processing.
*   **UI Scripts (`sidepanel.js`, `options.js`, etc.):** These scripts control the user-facing components, such as the side panel and options page. They handle user input, display data and progress updates, and send commands to the service worker to initiate tasks.

### Debugging Tips

*   **Service Worker:** To debug the background script, navigate to `chrome://extensions/`, find the InsightMiner extension, and click the "Service Worker" link. This will open a dedicated DevTools window where you can view console logs, inspect network requests, and debug the script.
*   **Side Panel:** To debug the side panel UI, right-click anywhere inside the panel and select "Inspect". This will open a DevTools window for the side panel's HTML and JavaScript context.
*   **Content Scripts:** To debug a content script, open the DevTools on the target website (e.g., a Reddit post). Console logs from the content script will appear in the site's main console. You can also find the script's source code under the "Sources" tab > "Content scripts" to set breakpoints.

### Running Tests

The repository includes several files for testing:
*   `test-background-modules.js`: Unit tests for individual background modules.
*   `test-functionality.js`: High-level checks for core extension functionality.
*   `test-integration.js`: An integration test suite that verifies the end-to-end workflow.
*   `test-modules.js`: A simple script to verify that all modules load correctly.

These tests are designed for developer verification and can be run in a browser console or a Node.js environment.

## Security & Privacy

This extension:
- Stores all data locally in your browser
- Stores OpenAI API keys locally (not recommended for production)
- Only accesses pages you explicitly visit
- Makes API calls to OpenAI with your credentials
- Allows you to clear all data at any time
- Enables you to choose your preferred AI model for analysis
- Allows customization of analysis prompts for specific use cases

**Important**: For production use, implement a backend proxy to keep your OpenAI API key secure.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Google Search Extraction Issues
- **Problem**: Only getting results from first page
- **Solution**: v2.0 now automatically extracts from up to 3 pages per query
- **Problem**: No search results found
- **Solution**: Check browser console for extraction errors, ensure Google search page is fully loaded

#### Reddit Extraction Progress Issues
- **Problem**: Progress shows 0% and doesn't update
- **Solution**: v2.0 includes enhanced progress tracking with real-time updates
- **Problem**: Extraction fails silently
- **Solution**: Check browser console for detailed error messages, failed URLs are now tracked and reported

#### Content Script Communication Issues
- **Problem**: "Could not establish connection" errors
- **Solution**: v2.0 includes fallback extraction mechanisms and better error handling
- **Problem**: Tabs open but no data extracted
- **Solution**: Ensure content scripts are properly injected, check manifest permissions

#### AI Analysis Issues
- **Problem**: OpenAI API errors
- **Solution**: v2.0 includes exponential backoff retry logic and better error messages
- **Problem**: Analysis results not showing
- **Solution**: Check OpenAI API key in extension options, ensure sufficient API credits

### Debug Mode
Enable browser console logging to see detailed extraction progress and error messages:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for messages starting with "AI Demand Intelligence Miner"

## Future Enhancements

- Backend proxy for secure API key management
- Additional AI models support (Claude, Gemini)
- Real-time analysis streaming
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Cloud storage integration
- Batch processing improvements
- Custom analysis prompts
- Team collaboration features
- Support for additional platforms (Hacker News, Product Hunt, etc.)
