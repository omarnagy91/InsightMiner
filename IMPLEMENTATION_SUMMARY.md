## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Search Query Generation
```javascript
// New generic prompt that adapts to any topic and platform
const systemPrompt = `You create precise Google queries that surface real user demand around any topic.

Context:
- Topic: {topic}
- Platform (domain or community): {platform}

Goal:
Return a SINGLE Google query string that finds high-signal, discussion-style pages...`;
```

### Per-Post Extraction Schema
```javascript
const PER_POST_SCHEMA = {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
        post_url: { type: "string" },
        topic: { type: "string" },
        platform: { type: "string" },
        items: {
            type: "object",
            properties: {
                ideas: { /* detailed schema for ideas */ },
                issues: { /* detailed schema for issues */ },
                missing_features: { /* detailed schema for missing features */ },
                pros: { /* detailed schema for pros */ },
                cons: { /* detailed schema for cons */ },
                emotions: { /* detailed schema for emotions */ },
                sentiment: { type: "string", enum: ["positive", "negative", "mixed"] }
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### Demand Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
const demandScore = freq_weight * Math.log(1 + mentionCount) +
                   recency_weight * recencyScore +
                   engagement_weight * engagementScore +
                   emotion_weight * emotionScore +
                   confidence_weight * confidenceScore;
```
